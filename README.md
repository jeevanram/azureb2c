# Introduction
Azure AD B2C is a Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) solution designed to support millions of users. It enables customers to single sign-on (SSO) and seamlessly access an organization's products and services across web and mobile platforms.

It is a white-label authentication solution, allowing full customization of the user interface and user journey to reflect an organizationâ€™s branding. Every page in the sign-up, sign-in, and profile management flows can be customized using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Azure AD B2C is built on the same underlying technology as Azure Active Directory, but it is tailored specifically for external customer identities. It supports a wide range of identity providers including social accounts (like Google, Facebook), enterprise accounts (via SAML or OpenID Connect), and local accounts. This allows customers to sign in with their preferred identity provider and gain single sign-on access to your applications and APIs.
